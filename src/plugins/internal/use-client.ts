/**
 * Ensures the `"use client"` directive appears at the very top of output files.
 *
 * `"use client"` directive must appear before any other
 * code, including imports. Currently Bun incorrectly places it after imports during builds.
 * This plugin fixes the directive placement by moving it to the start of affected files.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This is a temporary workaround until Bun fixes the directive placement issue.
 * Track the upstream fix at {@link https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/6854}
