## About This Repository

Here's a quick overview of the technologies we use:

- **[PNPM Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces):** For managing monorepos.
- **[Tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/):** A TypeScript bundler for building the project.
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev):** Our testing framework.

## Development

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and start contributing to bunup.

### Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the [bunup GitHub repository](https://github.com/arshad-yaseen/bunup).
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### Clone the Repository

Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arshad-yaseen/bunup.git
```

### Navigate to Project Directory

Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd bunup
```

### Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your work to keep changes organized:

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

### Install Dependencies

bunup uses PNPM for managing dependencies. Install them by running:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Building the Package

To build the package, execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command uses [Tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) to bundle the project.

#### Alternative: Start Development Mode

For automatic rebuilds on file changes, start the watch mode with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This is useful for continuous development and testing.

## Testing bunup Locally

The root test-playground.mjs file is provided for quick testing of the module during development. This is especially useful when:

- Adding new features
- Modifying existing functionality
- Testing package changes

To use the playground:

1. First build the package to reflect your changes:

    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```

    Or start watch mode for real-time testing:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

2. Run the playground:

    ```bash
    pnpm test:playground
    ```

The playground will automatically use your latest built changes when running in watch mode, making it perfect for rapid development and testing.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is essential.

- **Location:** The documentation is located within the `README.md` file at the root of the repository.
- **Format:** Documentation is written using Markdown.

### Viewing Documentation

To view the documentation, simply open the `README.md` file in your preferred text editor or view it directly on GitHub.

## Commit Conventions

Adhering to a consistent commit message format helps maintain a clear project history and facilitates collaboration.

**Commit Message Format:**

```plaintext

```

**Categories:**

- `feat` / `feature`: Introduces new features or functionality.
- `fix`: Addresses and resolves bugs.
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- `docs`: Updates or additions to documentation.
- `build`: Changes related to the build process or dependencies.
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests.
- `ci`: Changes to continuous integration configurations.
- `chore`: Miscellaneous tasks that do not fit into the above categories.
